Library Management System (LMS) is a system for running a library with I.T as a strategic tool instead of having to reply on manual notebooks. LMS gives you Rest API enabled standard Library functions (CRUD User, CRUD Book, CRUD Borrow/Return, CRUD Report) integrated with Thymleaf UI for better UI.
